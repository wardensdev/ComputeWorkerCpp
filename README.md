# ComputeWorkerCpp

This is a C++ port of the ComputeWorker plugin that is available on the Godot Asset Library. It's currently a work in progress. The core of the plugin is finished,
meaning the ComputeWorker node itself is fully implemented, along with UniformSets and the GPUUniform class, and a few of the GPUUniform-derived basic types.
